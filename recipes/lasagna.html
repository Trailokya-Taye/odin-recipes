        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagne originated in Italy during the Middle Ages. The oldest transcribed text about lasagne appears in 1282 in the Memoriali Bolognesi ("Bolognesi Memorials"), in which lasagne was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary; while the first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th-century Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery). It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagne, featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets (lasagne), boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick. Recipes written in the century following the Liber de Coquina recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended.</p>
